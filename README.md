# Linear Algebra using Numpy
In this `Repo`, you will have the opportunity to remember some basic concepts about linear algebra and how to use them in Python.

Numpy is one of the most used libraries in Python for arrays manipulation. It adds to Python a set of functions that allows us to operate on large multidimensional arrays with just a few lines. So forget about writing nested loops for adding matrices! With NumPy, this is as simple as adding numbers.

Let us import the `numpy` library and assign the alias `np` for it. We will follow this convention in almost every notebook in this course, and you'll see this in many resources outside this course as well.
