# Linear Algebra using Numpy
In this `Repo`, you will have the opportunity to remember some basic concepts about linear algebra and how to use them in Python.

Numpy is one of the most used libraries in Python for arrays manipulation. It adds to Python a set of functions that allows us to operate on large multidimensional arrays with just a few lines. So forget about writing nested loops for adding matrices! With NumPy, this is as simple as adding numbers.

You would review these cases:

- [ ] Defining lists and NumPy arrays
2. Matrix or Array of Arrays
3. Scaling and translating matrices
4. Transpose a matrix
5. Get the norm of an array or matrix
6. The dot product between arrays
7. Sums by rows or columns
8. Get the mean by rows or columns
9. ...
